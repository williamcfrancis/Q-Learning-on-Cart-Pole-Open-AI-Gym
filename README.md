# Q-Learning on the Cart-Pole problem
Cartpole - known also as an Inverted Pendulum is a pendulum with a center of gravity above its pivot point. Itâ€™s unstable, but can be controlled by moving the pivot point under the center of mass. The goal is to keep the cartpole balanced by applying appropriate forces to a pivot point.
